# Find support
<!--- Section owner: MTD Programme --->

We are here to help you and answer any questions you have about the CTC API. Also, your feedback is essential to us, because it helps us design APIs and systems that work best for you. 

You can email the [Software Development Support Team](mailto:sdsteam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk) with any CTC Traders API questions and support requests. If they can't help you themselves, they’ll find the help you need. Either way, some one will get back to as soon as we can. You’ll get an initial response in 2 working days. This means we’re on the case. 

### Check service availability

If your query is about service availability on the API platform, please check the [service availability](https://api-platform-status.production.tax.service.gov.uk/?_ga=2.145121908.112811846.1587044117-960820992.1580203223) page before emailing us. 
You can also subscribe for updates on this page and we’ll notify you about planned or unplanned service downtime. 

#### Helping you during our development phase

Please bear with us during this period of intensive development work. We will try to answer all your questions as rapidly as possible, but in some cases we may need more time during the transition from the NCTS API channel to the CTC Traders APIs. 
 

If you would like to take part in user research we'd like to hear from you. [Please email us.](mailto:sdsteam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk)
