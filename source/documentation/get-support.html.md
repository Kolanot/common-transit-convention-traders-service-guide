# Find support
<!--- Section owner: MTD Programme --->

We are here to help you and answer any questions you have about the CTC API. Also, your feedback is essential to us, because it helps us design APIs and systems that work best for you. 

### If you find a bug in our code

If you find a bug in our code please can you raise an issue with our developers on GitHub. We want to squash those right away. 

**[Report a bug](https://github.com/hmrc/common-transit-convention-traders/issues)**

### If you need other types of support 

You can get in touch our Software Development Support Team with any CTC Traders API questions and support requests. If they can't help you themselves, they’ll find the help you need. You’ll get an initial response in 2 working days. This means we’re on the case.
