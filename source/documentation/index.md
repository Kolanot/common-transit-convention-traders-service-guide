# Common Transit Convention Traders API end-to-end service guide

Version 0.2 issued 15 June 2020
***

This guide explains how you can use our new Common Transit Convention (CTC) Traders API with your software. The API will allow your software to send and receive movement notifications and status messages to and from the EUâ€™s New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). 

To trade between Europe and the UK, your software will need to change from using the NCTS XML API Channel to the CTC Traders API, aftrer 30 December 2020.

### Come back for regular updates

We are updating this guide as we add more functionality to our API, new technical specifications and other items we hope you find useful. 

## Overview

Right now, goods that can move freely within the UK can move across the EU freely too. This will change after the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. Then, those goods will be subject to duties and other charges when they enter the EU, or enter the UK from the EU.

From 2021, if UK traders want to defer paying these duties and other charges, they can move the goods under the Common Transit Convention. This will allow traders to move goods across a number of countries, without having to pay import duties every time they cross a border. They will only have to complete the paperwork and pay any duties they owe, once they reach their destination country.

The API will allow traders to send and received Arrival Notifications and Departure Notifications to customs and border offices.



### Why we are creating a new CTC Traders API

Common Transit will be a key procedure for moving goods between the United Kingdom and Europe. This will mean that declaration volumes will increase significantly. In order to make sure we provide a reliable and fast service we are introducing the new CTC Traders API to replace the current XML channel API.


### Changes that come with the new CTC Traders API

The table below gives you a brief outline of how the new API uses different coding, compared to the existing XML channel API.   

|**Activity** | **NCTS** | **CTC Traders API** |
|---|---|---|
|**Submit Arrival Notification message (IE007)** | SOAP authorisation (include username and password in clear text) | Government Gateway authorisation (OAuth2 token)| 
|**Create action**| SOAP wrapper, with embedded instruction | RESTful interface, action inferred from the URL | 
|**Post API Payload**| SOAP with EDIFACT body | Information Exchange message (IE) XML | 
|**Get API Payload**| SOAP with EDIFACT body|JSON and IE XML |

A few improvements the CTC Traders API will bring are:
* being ready for  the expected increase in CTC movements  
* improving security   
* making it easier to test and maintain with an updated coding language      
* creating a more reliable and robust cloud based service

### How we can help you with these changes

#### What you can do now: 
- **[Review our CTC Traders API definitions](https://developer.qa.tax.service.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/1.0)**  
- **[Take advantage of tutorials](https://developer.qa.tax.service.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/tutorials)** 
- **[Understand authorisation](https://developer.qa.tax.service.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation)**
- **[See what you can test in our roadmap](https://developer.qa.tax.service.gov.uk/roadmaps/common-transit-convention-traders-roadmap/#backlog)**

#### Find support

We have support in place to help you with any questions or problems you might have to do with the CTC Traders API. [See how we can support you](documentation/get-support.html). 


#### Check service availability
Before you get in touch, check out whether API downtime or technical issues are the problem. [Check the HMRC API plaform availability](https://api-platform-status.production.tax.service.gov.uk/?_ga=2.145121908.112811846.1587044117-960820992.1580203223)    


 
## End-to-end process

This section shows you how the API fits into various end-to-end user journeys. It aims to help you understand how your software needs to interact with HMRC systems after the changes.


### Get authorisation to use the API

In order to use the CTC Traders API your software needs to interact with the Government Gateway to [get authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints). 


### When these changes are happening 

We will release the new CTC Traders API into the NCTS production environment on 31 December 2020.

### What's happening for Northern Ireland transit

From 1 January 2021, the submission channel for Northern Ireland departure and arrival notification messages will be by email only. This is a temporary solution while we continue to work on getting the new API to also serve Northern Ireland. 

## Journey diagrams

Below are two simplified diagrams that give you an overview of the new processes involving the CTC Traders API:

- **[Sending an Arrival Notification: IE007](documentation/arrivals-diagram.html.md)** - See how you send an Arrival Notification to NCTS using the CTC Traders API.  


## Full specifications
You can see a see full list of messages and sequence diagrams specifications on the [NCTS Phase 4 Technical Interface Specification (TIS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-computerised-transit-system-technical-specifications) (this will be updated after 31 December 2020).   


We encourage you to include links to relevant guidance in your software.
