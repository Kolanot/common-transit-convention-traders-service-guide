# Journey maps
<!--- Section owner: CTC Traders API --->

We have split our journey maps into two categories. One to provide and overview of how our CTC Traders API will fit into your processes. The other category are more technical sequence diagrams to help developers understand the kind of responses they can expect. 

## An overview of the end to end journey

**[End-to-end journey](documentation/movements-diagram.html)** - See the end-to-end process of transporting goods using the CTC Traders API.

**[Simplified arrivals process](documentation/arrivals-diagram.html.md)**  - See a simplified process of sending an arrivals message.


## Technical coders' diagrams

We will be updating this section.
