# Test your work

## Test developments and updates

### CTC Trader Test API

From September 2020 you will be apple to use our Test API in HMRC's sandbox. This will allow you will be able to place CTC test messages as if they were from the NCTS. It is for use with HMRCâ€™s sandbox environment only.

Check out [Test Support API specifications](https://developer.staging.tax.service.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders-test-support/1.0)

### Trader Test service

In October 2020 you will be able to use our Trader Test service which will replace the Test API. Trader Test will allow you to request authentic messages from the NCTS

When this is available we will change the test pages we have to suit the Trader Test service. However, much  of it will stay the same, for instance, the test scenarios, diagrams, XSD and XML files.

### Scenario diagrams

To give yourself a clearer picture of message sequences we have create diagrams for a number of the scenarios. We also link the each of these diagrams from the test pages.

Check out our [diagrams](./test-support/diagrams.html#Diagrams for test scenarios)
